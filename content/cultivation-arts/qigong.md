## My Understandings

### Yijin Jing (易筋经)

*   According to Damo Mitchell[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)
    *   No exercises mentioned in the text.
    *   Purpose:
        *   Transform the body to be ready for the advanced practice Xisui Jing (洗髓经)
        *   Retain physical vitality
        *   Improve blood flow
        *   Open channels
        *   Strengthen or accumulate Qi
        *   Prepare you for Xisui Jing (洗髓经), which is really about "washing" the brain, improving cell production and reaching enlightenment.
    *   Method
        *   Physical must follow the intangible.

        *   Develop Qi first, via Qigong, which fills the huang (肓), like 肓膜 or the connective tissue between the organs and muscles and tendons and bones; basically everything that's not specific entities that we know on a daily basis, like the mesentry.
        *   The huang (肓) then develops and becomes stronger, filling the space, almost like inflating.
        *   This then results in strengthing the muscles and giving them a more striated, tendon like aspect making that strong but flexible, of good quality.

        *   Errors

        *   Building the muscles first, which results in San Song ??, where at a later age the muscle become decrepit, because they don't have the foundation of the qi and huang.
        *   Building the tendons first, which develops qi stagnations.
        *   Developing the huang (肓) without qi, which results in no power.
            *   Not sure how huang (肓) would even be developed without qi.
