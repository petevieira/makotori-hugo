# Syntax Trees
* Mental computations of language:
  * performed on a hierarchically organized structure, not on a linear string of words
* How are words organized into a sentence?
  * H1: A sentence is a collection words?
    * NO! Doesn't account for word order
  * H2: A sentence is an *ordered* collection of words?
    * NO! Can't tell us why sentence a is good and b is bad
    * NO! Doesn't capture intuition/fact that not all substrings of a sentece are "created equal"
      * Some substrings contain words that *"belong"* more together than others, i.e., more "cohesive."

# Tests of Cohesiveness
  1. Substitution
  1. Movement
  1. Questions/Fragment Answers

## Substitution
Cohesive substrings can be replaced with other words while maintaining the meaning of the sentence.

- "This guy took **his dog** to **his girlfriend** today."
  - "This guy took his dog to [her] today."
  - "This guy took [it] to his girlfriend today."

This type of substitution isn't possible with non-cohesive substrings.
<br>What about these substrings:
- This guy took his **dog to** his **girlfriend today**."

## Movement
Cohesive substrings can be movement to different parts of the sentence.

- "This guy took **his dog** to **his girlfriend** today."
  - "His dog, this guy took to his girlfriend today."
  - "To his girlfriend, this guy took his dog."

What about these substrings:
- "This guy took his **dog to** his **girlfriend today**."

## Questions/Fragment Answers
- "This guy took **his dog** to **his girlfriend** today."
  - Q: [**What**] did this guy take to his girlfriend today?"
    - A: [**his dog**]
  - Q: [**Who**] did this guy take his dog to today?
    - A: [**his girlfriend**]
  - Q: ...?
    - A: \*[**novel to**]

**"cohesive substrings" = "consituents"**
