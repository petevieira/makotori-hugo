# Raja Yoga (राज योग)

## Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras

### External Limbs

#### Yama
- Respect for others
    - nonviolence, truth, honesty, moderation, non-covetousness

#### Niyama
*   Positive self-action
    *   purity, contentment, discipline, self-study, devotion

#### Asana
*   Patanjali simply instructs one to find a comfortable yet stable seated position.

#### Pranayama
*   Patanjali only instructs the Raja yogi to observe and slow the breath down to the point where one cannot distinguish between the inhalation and the exhalation.

### Internal Limbs

#### Pratyahara
*   It is the drawing of the mind’s focus away from the external senses to the inner sensations of the body.

#### Dharana
*   It is used to concentrate the mind on a single object, usually the breath.
*   Keeping the mind focused and releasing attachment to thoughts.
*   When one obtains the ability to concentrate the mind on a single object to the point of being completely absorbed in it, then one has moved into the next limb

#### Dhyana
*   Meditation
*   When the mind is absorbed in Dhyana the thoughts cease and the mind stills.
*   The sustained practice of Dhyana leads to the last limb

#### Samadhi
*   Enlightenment, ecstasy, and bliss
*   One sees pure awareness reflected on the still surface of the mind.
*   Object, subject and perceiving all melt into a feeling of oneness.
