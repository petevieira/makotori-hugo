*   Position: 15 min half-lotus, 10 min sitting-crane
*   Duration: 15 min, 30 sec pause, 10 min
*   Experience:

*   Jin (). Partner with Qi and needs to be cultivated. Unknown in the West
*   Jin most often must be imparted upon student so they can feel it and then work on it. But it’s not impossible with a master for a trained martial artist.
*   Hard, soft-hard and soft styles (how jin is manifested)
*   Hard: qi is led to muscles, muscles are tensed to trap qi
*   The meaning of learning arts is to find and understand yourself. With this understanding, you can promote the meaning of your life to a higher spiritual level.
*   The arts are creative. After you have learned and practiced for a long time, then you should blend what you have learned with you own ideas to make the arts even greater.
*   A deeply touching art is created from deep spiritual feelings.
*   The greatest secret is hidden in the most obvious place and can be obtained only from continued pondering and practice.
*   Read up to, not including The Real Meaning of Taijiquan
*   Obstacles
    *   Studying these concepts make it more difficult to stay motivated and find meaning in learning piano, etc.

## Meditation

*   Duration: 17 min
*   Position: cross-legged
*   Experience:
    *   Didn’t set a timer. Was quite comfortable. Stopped when I felt like it.

## Qigong

*   5 movements. Felt good.

## Study

*   Song
    *   No shape no shadow.
    *   In high levels of taiji meditation body seems not to exist. You feel you are a ball of energy and part of the world. Your actions and self are part of the natural order and have no shape, no shadow.
*   Entire body transparent and empty.
    *   When you are a ball of energy, your mind is empty. No ego, no intentions, and can respond correctly.
*   Forget your surroundings and be natural.
    *   Transparency entails free-flowing energy
*   Like a stone chime suspended from West Mountain.
    *   Your mind is wide-open and free. Things are clear but you are still in control of your mind.
*   Tigers roaring, monkeys screeching.
    *   Your cultivated energy can be as strong as a tiger’s roar and reach as far as a monkey’s screeching.
*   Clear fountain, peaceful water.
    *   Energy when your energy is strong, your mind is still and peaceful.
*   Turbulent river, stormy ocean.
    *   If you have to use your energy, it can be strong and continuous.
*   With your whole being, develop your life.
    *   During all your practice, you must concentrate all your attention in order to develop the highest level of the art. This dedication and concentration will carry over to the rest of your life, and the striving for perfection becomes the real inner meaning of taiji.
*   Meditation in movements and stillness
*   Goal: judge things in a neutral way, without emotional disturbance
*   Meditation and pondering is the key to getting rid of confusion and doubt and understanding the world better, finding peace and happiness.
*   Many different styles of Yang taiji. Understanding the history is important.
*   Its creation from theory of Yin and Yang is important
    *   Yin and yang are derived from 无极 (wuji, no extremity). First detailed in Book of Changes (易经）
*   Balance of yin and yang is most important goal in taiji practice
*   张三丰: “creator” of taiji in Song Hui Zong era (C.E. 1101)
*   Two major styles: old and new
    *   Old style: 13 postures old form (十三氏落架) -> Yang style
    *   Old style -> Zhao Bao style
    *   Old + New -> Wuu style
*   Wuu style -> Li style
*   Li style -> Hao style
*   Hao style -> Sun style
*   Yang style started with Yang Lu-chan (C.E. 1799-1872), born in Yong Nian Xian, Guang Ping County, Hebei Province
*   Watched secretly his master performing ‘hen’ and ‘ha’ techniques controlling and emitting 劲 (jin)
*   Emitted at the moment of laughing “ha” sound.
*   Yang Postures
    *   Large, medium, small
    *   Large: good for improving health
    *   Medium: all forms are neither too extended nor too restricted and jin is neither totally emitted nor too conserved.
    *   Small: martial application of the art
*   Self-defense and health are closely related concepts, separated only by a philosophical frame of mind. Such comparisons of techniques are meaningless. The time, quality and consistency of practice is what matters.
*   Yang stances:
    *   High, medium, low
*   Taijiquan is a qigong training following the natural cultivation and training procedures of qigong - known as the five regulations (五调, wutiao)
*   五调
    *   调身 (tiaoshen, regulating the body)
    *   Along with learning the movements,
    *   Physical relaxation. Relax your mind, feel the balance of your body and maintain your physical and mental centers.
    *   To do this you must practice until you’ve strengthened and firmed your torso and legs.
    *   Basic condition for your health. With this, qi and blood circulation can flow smoothly. Cell replacement will occur without error, a key to health and longevity.
*   调息 (tiaoxi, regulating the breath)
    *   Pay attention to breathing and how your body absorbs oxygen and expels carbon dioxide smoothly and profoundly.
    *   Oxygen help build new cells, while deep exhalation helps eliminate dead cells.
    *   Carbon dioxide exists from:
        *   biochemical combustion of the food we eat
        *   body’s decay and replenishment. Each cell has a lifetime (skin cells die after 28 days). A trillion cells die each day. We must eliminate these dead cells.
    *   Use as much lung capacity as possible without tensing up
    *   Helps prepare for next stage of regulating the mind.
    *   Breath is a pathway between external and internal universes
*   调心 (tiaoxin, regulating the mind)
    *   Mind directs body against sickness
    *   Mind has 意 (yi, wisdom mind) and 心 (xin, emotional mind)
        *   意 responsible for intellect and higher mental functions
        *   心 encompasses all emotional states and passions, originator of desire and aggression and from it flows all actions and intentions manifested to the physical world. It is selfish and fearful, and if not properly regulated by the wisdom mind, it will lead you to destructive purposes.
    *   Must learn to calm down emotional mind and strengthen you wisdom mind.
    *   Must constantly conquer yourself and ponder the meaning of your life.
    *   Goal: deeply profound, peaceful, harmonious state.
    *   Only then can you use your whole mind to lead and circulate qi.
    *   This training builds connections between mind, body and qi.
*   调气 (tiaoqi, regulating the Qi)
    *   With a peaceful mind, relaxed body and correct breathing you can lead qi to anywhere in your body.
*   调神 (tiaoshen, regulating the spirit)
    *   Final stage is regulating the spirit and strengthening the spiritual center.
    *   Use your mind to lead the qi through the thrusting vessel 冲脉 (chongmai, spinal chord) to the brain, energizing it and opening the third eye for enlightenment.
*   Taijiquan classic. What is taiji?
    *   Taiji is generated from 无极 and is a pivotal function of movement and stillness.
    *   It is the mother of yin and yang
    *   When it moves it divides. At rest it reunites
*   Daoist conception of creation of the universe
    *   Initial it was without life. All was foggy and blurry, without differentiation or separation, with no extremities or ends.
    *   This state was called 无极
    *   Later the existing energy divided into two extremities, yin and yang
    *   This polarity, or tendency to divide is called 太极 (taiji, Grand Ultimate, Grand extremity)
    *   This initial separation allows and causes all subsequent divisions and changes
*   How to define Taiji?
    *   At initial point of practice, mind, breath, body are still and calm, you are in a state of 无极. Qi is centered, you lack intentions, weight is evenly distributed.
    *   The moment you intend to move and start a movement, you are in a state of 太极 (ie. 阴 and 阳 start to be differentiated to perception.) You weight changes from one foot to the other, changes happen.
    *   So 太极 in 太极拳 is the intention of motivation generated from the mind that causes the 阴 and 阳 to be discriminated. It is this mind that shapes reality. It is this mind that guides us to a deeper understanding. And this mind learns to achieve and perceive other types of 阴 and 阳.
    *   So the mind is the 道 in 太极拳 practice.
    *   太极拳 is primarily an art of the mind.
*   The 8 trigrams derived from taiji
    *   太极 (Taiji, Grand Ultimate)
        *   阴 (Yin Yi, Yin Pole)
            *   太阴 (Tai Yin, Strong Yin)
                *   坤 (Kun, Earth) ☷
                *   艮 (Gen, Mountain) ☶
            *   少阳 (Shao Yang, Weak Yang)
                *   坎 (Kan, Water) ☵
                *   巽 (Xun, Wind) ☴
        *   阳 (Yang Yi, Yang Pole
            *   少阴 (Shao Yin, Weak Yin)
                *   震 (Zhen, Thunder) ☳
                *   离 (Li, Fire) ☲
            *   太阳 (Tai Yang, Strong Yang)
                *   兑 (Dui, Lake) ☱
                *   乾 (Qian, Heaven) ☰
*   Yin Yang symbol
    *   Circle and curved dividing line
    *   Both yin and yang are generated and contained in roundness
    *   Smooth dividing line means they interact smoothly and efficiently
    *   Extreme yang weakens and evolves into yin, first weak and then extreme yin.
    *   Extreme yin weakens and evolves into yang, first weak and then extreme yang.
    *   This evolutions is continuous and everlasting
    *   Dot in center of yin and dot in center of yang
    *   There exists no absolute yin or yang
    *   There is a seed or source of yin in yang, and vice versa

## Questions to answer

*   Why do I want to learn 太极?
    *   Because I’m on a constant quest to better understand life and find deeper, more unifying and universal meaning in it.
    *   I believe hundreds of wise people have shown us that a form of peace and enlightenment exists.
    *   I believe and have seen proof in science that 太极 offers many health benefits, so I am intrigued and would like to follow a path that promotes self healing, self awareness and longevity.
*   What benefits do I hope to gain?
    *   Better health and longevity
    *   Inner and outer peace. A better relationship with the world.
    *   A more unifying perspective of the world and the living things in it.
    *   A better understanding of our place in the world
    *   A stronger body, mind, and spirit
    *   The ability to really feel, control and use 气 and 劲 for health and to give others evidence of truth in 太极
*   Am I likely to continue training for a long time?
    *   This is a harder question. I believe the focus on mind and body in the first stage is very important to me, because just working the body lacks motivation and purpose and sense. How can one master the body without incorporating the mind and breath. I believe in the ultimate goals of 太极 and the path to these goals always seems to keep the goal in mind and is coherent, which will prevent me from straying off course.
*   Questions about the style and master to prevent doubt or confusion
    *   Does this 太极拳 style offer what I want?
    *   Is the master qualified?
    *   Does this master have a training schedule?
    *   How long and deep can this master teach me?
    *   Will the master teach me everything he knows or will he keep secrets when I approach a certain level?
    *   After I have studied for many years, will I be able to find an advanced master to continue my studies?
*   To answer these questions, I must survey and investigate. I must know the historical background of the style and the master’s experience.

*   wing chun punching in air

    *   I felt almost immediately extremely strong sensations in my arms. It's like a push/pull feeling that feels related to the blood pressure in my arms. It's like they are full of blood or like the blood is pushing towards the hands and not relenting and in trying to coordinate my breath with this sensation it's not clear what the interactions are. My attempts involve 1) trying to just maintain a 10-sec respiration, or 2) inhale focusing on the sensation in the arms and once the sensation starts to decrease immediately start inhaling, etc.
    *   This is the first time I've had such immediate sensations like this without previous qigong-specific exercises.

# 2020-05-10

## Meditation

*   5:40am, 20 min. Felt much longer. Need to start going longer. Hands on knees in mudra. But the fact that it felt longer means to me that it was successful. It didn't require a lot of effort.
*   Focused on loud breath, first with tongue to palate, then tongue in bottom of mouth where it naturally rests for me.
*   Then transitioned to focusing on energy sensation in body, arms, hands because it feels like if the idea is that we are just an energy and we want to remove the body and identification, then focusing on the energy seems only natural.
*   Then transitioned to qigong small circle which took a second but then got strong sensations that eventually dissipated, but the focus was good.
*   Then transitioned to qigong sitting large circle which I didn't like as much because it was too much movement which required more thought and I started to get cold, maybe cause with my arms going above my head every cycle, my sleeves were falling.
*   Had some thoughts but only a handful related to the experience and wanting to journal it, and things I wanted to write in my to-look-into list.

## Food

*   Small bowl of oatmeal/granola with strawberries and banana

## Yoga

*   1h30min Ashtanga First Series with David Swenson ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tWnDWz5A0Q))

    *   Was able to do more of the vinyasas and a couple poses that I couldn't figure out last time.
    *   End relaxation was amazing, but thought about stuff. Was more easily able to visualize body melting away and skeleton aligning and then melting away.

## Breakfast

*   Eggs and eight treasures

# 2020-05-11 (Rain)

## Meditation

*   6:10am, 30 min. Right foot on left calf. Hands in mudra on knees.
*   Focused on breath, the sound of it. Did some chanting of Om Mani Padme Hum which was kinda nice, but I'd be interested in something longer and that I identify with more. Unclear. After a 20 or 25 min it was hard not to stop. Feels like a lot of effort with a lot of push-back from my own thoughts.
*   Seems like when I was at Mouna's place I had fewer things on my mind, whereas at my place I'm thinking about Avatar, measurements, JavaScript, linguistics, etc.

*   15 min, left foot in front of right (progress)
*   Focused on tiny energy feelings in body, mostly arms and focused on directing that energy into arms and to hands.
*   Did moving meditation with qigong hands/arms concentrating on sensations in arms and directing the energy. It was interesting.
*   Thoughts:
    *   Seems to me that the energy includes some portion of just our blood pumping and maybe we can develop the ability to control, or rather nudge, it in directions, like to the hands which builds up more heat, measured in tests via statistically significantly more photons leaving the hands.

# 2020-05-21

## Meditation

*   25 min. Comfortable in butt-lifted position with right foot on left calf.
*   A bit lost due to the many ways people suggest to do meditation, from focusing on choiceless awareness to focusing on the breath or certain elements. There are different goals to different types of meditation.
    *   We know that concentration meditation leads to both theta and beta waves in the brain, which usually are separate, one activated during sleep, the other during concentration activities.
    *   As in the Pāli texts there is meditation that focuses on the four elements and discerning these qualities within the body.
    *   There is Jiddu Krishnamurti who believes that concentration meditation is pointless without first knowledge of oneself, which requires choiceless awareness and the understanding all the conditioning and experience that makes oneself them, and only then can one act creatively and intentionally.
*   I still have trouble getting past 25 or 30 minutes. It may not be too many thoughts but a lack of a clearly defined aim. Do you focus on the breath or on waiting for thoughts to arise and observing them and letting them pass?
*   My goals are
    *   To understand myself and the world better
    *   To improve my health and abilities
    *   To strengthen my mind which will help strengthen my body, which together help create a long healthy life
    *   To increase my love and compassion and remove conditioned judgment and reactions. To see reality, not conditioned responses to stimuli.
*   But while the pursuit of understanding oneself is a lifelong journey, it is still not entirely clear what that means and how one achieves it. Potentially disciplines awareness of oneself and one's actions. But if one observes one actions, sure they can avoid interference, but there probably must be a later step where one considers what has been observed and processes it somehow. Works it into the conception of the self in a way in which the awareness of these behaviors allows related actions to either continue existing or slowly disappear. I'm not sure.

# 2020-05-24

## Meditation

*   15 min. 8am. Repeated line from Legend of Korra, "let go your earthly tether. enter the void. empty and become wind". It worked quite well, especially being in English and something that I understand.

## Snack

*   4 breakfast cookies

## Warmup

*   Rotation of all joints, 8 times in each direction.

## Qigong

*   八段锦 (from memory). Working on doing movements more smoothly, especially the legs when I step, I did them more like in Taiji where you keep all your weight on the static leg and move the free leg very slowly and fluidly to the next position and keeps your hands and arms fluid as well. Felt more energy in body this time. Helps also to pause during up and down breathing.

## Nunchaku

*   Martial. Practiced free-form imagining enemies and really enjoyed. It brought a new element to the practice and required adaptation because the motivation for speed and power was different and resulted in different behavior of the nunchaku.

# 2020-05-26

## Meditation

*   15 min. 8:00am
*   Focused on mantra: Let go of your earthy tethers, enter the void. Be empty and become the wind. I did this both aloud and in my head.
*   It definitely has a positive effect on keeping concentration. But it's beyond my level and I should be chanting something more basic.

## Breakfast

*   Breakfast cookies

## Yoga (9am)

*   2h Ashtanga First Series with David Swenson ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tWnDWz5A0Q))
*   Tired and more difficult this time. Don't know why.
*   Left hip/knee still has trouble, but learning ways of modifying stretching to avoid any pain. Like in seated forward bend with left foot in against right thigh, if I keep my left food further from my groin it help avoid pain in my medial meniscus.

## Breakfast

*   Eggs with lots of veggies, fig bread, later apple w/ peanut butter and then banana

* * *

# 2020-05-27

## Meditation

*   30 min. 5:30am. Seated not crossed nor foot on calf. Right leg in front to offset normal left leg in front position. Wondering if do left leg in front too often causes misalignment.
*   Chanting in head "Let go of your earthy tethers, enter the void, be empty and become the wind." Chanting it non-stop in my head no matter was part of the breath cycle I was on.
*   Changed to chanting something more suitable, "Let go of thyself and be energy." Short and sweet, continuous in-head chanting.
*   Ended feeling lots of energy in arms and hands and when a filling and emptying cycle of energy in arms occurs and I tried to focus on my breath and maintaining the filling energy sensation in my arms and was able to maintain it for half a dozen breath cycles. This is a first.

## Snack

# 2020-05-28

## Meditation

*   Evening. 30 min
*   Once again more than 30 min was tough.
*   I focused on the aggregate physical phenomena which is all things, as stated repeatedly throughout the ______. I repeated the words “physical phenomena” while thinking about all things physical: my body, my thoughts, my sensations, other people’s bodies, their thoughts, the elements in my body: earth, water, fire, wind. All things are physical phenomena.
*   I focused on my breath and on the sensations in my body and my arms.
*   I felt new sensations of full-body (especially in the head and upper-body) energy.

* * *

# 2020-05-29

## Meditation

*   1 hour. 30 minutes with right leg on left calf, then switched. 1 hour was not easy, but I continued to tell myself to be tough and anything was possible if you just do it.
*   Again I focused on the aggregate physical phenomena which is all things, as stated repeatedly throughout the ______. I repeated the words “physical phenomena” while thinking about all things physical: my body, my thoughts, my sensations, other people’s bodies, their thoughts, the elements in my body: earth, water, fire, wind. All things are physical phenomena.
*   I focused on my breath and on the sensations in my body and my arms.
*   During the first 30 mins it’s quite easy for me to stay focused on my breath, the sensations in my body, to be objective and aware of my experience.
*   During the second 30 mins focus became harder. I was notice I had drifted into contemplation for a bit and would pull myself back into focus.

## Yoga (9am)

*   2h Ashtanga First Series with David Swenson ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tWnDWz5A0Q))
*   Felt good and made progress on some postures.

## Breakfast

*   Eggs, fig bread

## Thoughts

*   I’ve been reading the book about the life of Dipa Ma. There are many testimonies, many of which feel naive to me.
*   A bodhisattva was being worshiped and giving prayers to people and a person asked why he’s so elaborate when Dipa Ma is down-to-earth and simple. She said to show how wonderful the Dharma is. Going to someone for prayers or putting people on pedestals seems unaligned with the dharma and I question someone that claims to be “enlightened” who lets people worship them. Coming to receive advice, or experience the person and their presence, that I understand. But the idea of the dharma is that we are all the same and on the path to enlightenment, just in different stages.
*   Also, I feel so many of the ideas that people struggle with in the testimonies, I overcame long ago. So many philosophies that release one from “suffering”, such as understanding impermanence and therefore being okay when a loved-one dies or when you lose something or get something stolen. That expectation of an imagined reality needlessly create consequences that involve suffering. That positive thinking and love bring a form of happiness and peace and exude itself around others.
*   In 8th grade I had female friends say it felt like I was looking into their soles. But it wasn’t until study abroad in Japan when I had friends who started expressing that my presence was calming and secure, that I didn’t meet people with judgement. This seems similar with how people describe being in the presence of Dipa Ma. Perhaps when we are in the presence of someone who judges, we feel anxiety and we feel these thoughts and feelings from the other person via all of their body language, their eyes, they respiration, their perspiration. Maybe all of that can be perceived unconsciously. And when there is no judgement, but instead acceptance and love, or a sort, we perceive just peace and acceptance, which brings a stillness to our perceptions of the others person and consequently within ourselves.

Perhaps when one is enlightened to a certain degree they hold these feelings and values more strongly and more consistently and thus the ambiance that they exude is stronger.

*   Dipa Ma seems to have various health issues and I find it curious when practitioners don’t value their body. Maybe that acts as a hindrance to enlightenment, but while a healthy body may not be required for enlightenment, it seems like it can only help the mind, since body and mind are interconnected, the mind is a part of the body. It also leads to a longer and more healthy life.
*   This observation leads me to conclude more decisively that “enlightenment” is very related to awareness, love, and detachment from conditioning and false perceptions, but it doesn’t mean you suddenly know everything or that you can’t end up with many issues in your life. The outcome is that these issues, or sufferings, no longer cause emotional suffering because you don’t identify with them and because suffering is expected in this world.
*   The cycle of reincarnation is intriguing. There doesn’t seem to be an explanation for why children all with the same genes can have completely different propensities and natures, seemingly irrespective of experiences. Physical conditions are one thing. But in the realm of a health physical brain, what decides whether you are more enlightened or more prone to find enlightenment naturally than another? Physically I wouldn’t say it makes sense that the essence of a person someone finds its way into a fetus in some woman’s womb, though.

## Hike

*   Walked 13.8 km (8.6 mi) 326 m (1060 ft) up, 260 m (850 ft) down.
*   Jogged 6 km (3.7 mi)
*   Tried to do walking meditation most of the time by concentrating on my breath and the up and down movement of my belly. When I started thinking about something I said "thinking" in my head. When I heard something I said "hearing" in my head, etc.

## Yoga

*   Ashtanga yoga class with friend Francoise. 7:30am 1h.
*   It was much more laid-back and slower, with fewer postures obviously and less intense versions.
*   I learned many things I was doing incorrectly, each in chataranga and up-dog. I wasn't keeping my shoulder blades protracted (separating the blades), which is much, much harder.
*   Books on Yoga: [link](http://yoga-ashtanga.net/en/books-on-traditional-yoga/)
*   Yoga's goals are pretty much the same as buddhist or Jiddu Krishnamurti: to get rid of the movement of thoughts in the mind and have just creative awareness, concentration, and lovingkindness.

## Meditation

*   6am, 30 min. Focused on belly movement and breath. Tons of thoughts but was ok with them.
*   Many thoughts felt useful and good to see from point of view of meditator and not from lost in those thoughts.
*   I like the relationship meditation give me with my thoughts, and the mindset or mental state it puts me in. It's like watching a movie of my brain and objectively identifying things, like stressors, actions that will help it, actions that need to be done, etc.
*   15 min doing lovingkindness meditation. Would like to review Dipa Ma's instruction, but it was nice and felt productive in feeling better about people that are easy to be angry about, like agressive people, litterers, etc. I feel as though lovingkindness has a power to conquer. I want everyone to be happy and I forgive them. Punishment or justice is necessary too and not all problems are fixable in this lifetime and many people are sick from birth or from social conditioning, but we can still love them in spite of all that and continue to exude and show forgiveness to counter these conditionings.
