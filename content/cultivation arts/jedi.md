# Five Core Precepts
1. **There is no emotion, there is peace**
    - This principle guides all meditations and interactions with others.
    - It reaffirms the ideal to act without recklessness and view the actions of others through the pure lens of the Unifying Force.
    - Is the emotion appropriate for the context? An emotion is not a problem in and of itself, but how it forms, and how the experience informs our actions can be.
    - Peace is to not engage in conflict with yourself; it is to accept emotion and use it as information to remain congruent in the situation.
    - Your emotional content does not have to become an action.
1. **There is no ignorance, there is knowledge**
    - Those who don't understand this are quick to fear

1. **There is no passion, there is serenity**
    -  This reminder to act dispassionately in every deliberation extends to personal obsessions and is a reminder not to elevate the self above the mission.

1. **There is no chaos, there is harmony**
    - Those who cannot see the threads uniting all life view existence as random and without purpose.
    - The Jedi perceive the structure and will of the many galaxies.

1. **There is no death, there is the Force**
    - All things die, but the Force lives on.
    - The end of our existence in this form is not to be overly mourned.
    - We are part of an energy larger than ourselves.
